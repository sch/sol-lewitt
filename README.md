Sol LeWitt created instructional artworks, and left the implementation to draftsmen. This project aims to create a declarative grammar for these types of artworks where the computer can do the drafting.


## Getting it running

This is your typical figwheel song and dance:

    lein figwheel
    open http://localhost:3449


## Some notes about SVG rendering

This is using rum to build of a tree of SVG elements. Right now, the `svg` component takes a `drawing` definition map, which it knows how to destructure into SVG elements. This is kind of awkward, but I'm going with it as a possible path.

Side-note: do none of these clojurescript react wrappers support component definitions that can display `children` props? This is a [super useful(https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/multiple-components.html#children) feature in react, and it's surprising not finding that functionality in any of these libs (reagent, quiescent, rum).
