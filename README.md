Sol LeWitt created instructional artworks, and left the implementation to draftsmen. This project aims to create a declarative grammar for these types of artworks where the computer can do the drafting.


## Getting it running

This is your typical figwheel song and dance:

    lein figwheel
    open http://localhost:3449


## Some notes about closure SVG

Some SVG info: the closure libraries used to have a generic drawing API that's implemented in canvas, SVG, and VML modules. They deprecated it.

The SVG lib is pretty useful still though, and this project uses it for low-level drawing commands without incurring heavy libs like Snap.svg or building it up with a virtual dom library, since we're simply re-drawing everything when changes occur. Maybe unwise. A likely change will be re-implementing the drawing functions with Quiescent.
