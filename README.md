Sol LeWitt created conceptual artworks, leaving the interpretation and implementation to draftsmen. From his "Paragraphs on Conceptual Art":

> "In Conceptual Art the idea or the concept is the most important aspect of the work. All planning and decisions are made beforehand and execution is a perfunctory affair. The idea is the machine that makes the art."

This project aims to create a declarative grammar for these types of artworks where the computer can do the drafting. Here's a screenshot:
